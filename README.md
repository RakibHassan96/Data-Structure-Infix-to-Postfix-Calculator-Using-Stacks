# Data Structures Infix to Postfix Calculator using Stacks

The user will be asked to input two variables:
Example:
A = 5
B = 3

The user will be asked for an equation:
Example:
Y = (A + 5) * (7 + 2)  / B

Program will take the infix equation, convert it to postfix and then solve for Y variable with stack implementation:
Example:
Y = 30


** Only works for 1 digit numbers!
